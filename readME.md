# Jukebox in Sinatra
## learning SQL via SQLite3

This app is a simple Jukebox, where users can navigate through from artists to
albums to tracks.

Originally developed for a le wagon 'optional' challenge, but extended to add additional features
and practice my HTML / CSS front end.

Still requires an API to link in actual music

### running this app
